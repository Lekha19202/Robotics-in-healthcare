The increasing demands of delivering higher quality global healthcare has resulted in an expansion in the development of computer-based and robotic healthcare. 
Our review provides how healthcare robotics can facilitate aged people, its emphasis on physical and social support. Under this we would briefly talk about
the future developments, considerations and applications of healthcare robots. Healthcare robots are not only used as a part of taking care of aged people who
face different challenges, they can be used to overcome the  shortage of healthcare personnel. This can be also used widely when there is an unexpected pandemic 
like COVID-19. Robotic technologies have contributed to enhance the physical limits of human workers in terms of repeatability, safety, durability, and accuracy .
This robotic system significantly reduces the risk of transmission of infectious diseases.  The automatons can monitor, evaluate, research and treat the 
patients at a safer distance. The goal is to encourage knowledge about healthcare robots so that it will be effective to tackle situations similar to the crisis
of covid-19 and also in day to day medicine routines to improve the quality of  care in high precision surgery. This paper  includes advances, challenges and
different applications of robotics in the field of healthcare.
